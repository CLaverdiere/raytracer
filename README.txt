A simple raytracer for UMBC CMSC 435.

Making / Running the project:
  - Use 'make pic_name.png' to run the raytracer with 'pic_name.nff'.
  - This generates a .pam, and converts to a .png.
  - Or, just run ./bin/trace pic_name.nff to just generate the .pam file.

See the top of 'src/main.cpp' for program settings.

Directory structure:
  - bin:  The raytracer binary.
  - nff:  All nff files.
  - pics: All pictures generated by raytracer.
  - src:  Source files (cpp, h)
