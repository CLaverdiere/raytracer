A simple C++ raytracer with shadows, reflection, and refraction.

Making / Running the project:
  - Use 'make pic_name.png' to run the raytracer with 'pic_name.nff'.
  - This generates a .pam, and converts to a .png automatically.
  - Or, just run './bin/trace pic_name.nff' to generate the .pam file.
  - Also accepts support from stdin. ie: './tetra -s 3 | ./bin/trace'

Configuration:
  - See the top of 'src/main.cpp' for program settings and cli flags.

Features:
  - Both sphere and triangle tracing.
  - Different shading modes, shadows, reflections, refraction.

Directory structure:
  - bin:  The raytracer binary.
  - nff:  All nff files.
  - pics: All pictures generated by raytracer.
  - src:  Source files (cpp, h).
